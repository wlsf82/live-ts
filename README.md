# Live TAT - TypeScript

Sample project to demonstrate the basics of TypeScript for the [JS for QAs](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-eblSNRj0QH36XrwvGfhh14GjpG-ViS2) playlist of the [Talking About Testing](https://www.youtube.com/c/talkingabouttesting) channel on YouTube.

## Pre-requirements

It's required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this program.

I've used versions `v14.17.3` and `6.14.13` respectively while creating this project.
I recommend using the same or later versions.

## Installation

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the project dependencies.

## Running the program

Before running the program, it needs to be compiled.

Run `npm run cleanup:and:compile` to do that.

After that, run `npm run execute` to run the program.

**Note:** After running it, you should have an output like that

```sh
> node index.js

myName is a variable of type:  string
